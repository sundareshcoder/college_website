    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <img  id="im" src="https://www.bsmcoer.com/Campus/Transport.jpg" width="700px;">
   <h4 class="trans">A full fledged Transport department functions in the college with buses to provide transport facility to students and staff from various places.<br> This service is offered ensuring a hassle-free and safe transportation.

    The College runs 85 buses for providing transport facility to students from various places in the city. The number of buses will be increased corresponding to the increase in the intake of students.
    <br>1.  Improved on-time performance: Consistently late buses can seriously disrupt students' schedules and make them unnecessarily late for class. Transportation scheduling software can track buses' schedules, and that data can be used to determine better ways to improve routing or scheduling and improve on-time performance.<br>
    2.  GPS-verified pickup and arrival: It can be extremely frustrating for students who rely on a campus transportation service to feel like they are just guessing when the bus will arrive. Transportation software can monitor pickup and arrival via GPS, which students can check to see when their bus is scheduled to pick them up and how long it will take to get to their destination.</h4>
